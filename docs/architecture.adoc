== Chore solution: https://antora.org/[Antora]

Antora is a multi-repository documentation site generator.

The Antora playbook is configured by the file _antora-playbook.yml_. +
This configuration file lists all the components, and the branches to build. It also references the UI bundle and some additional Asciidoctor extensions, both used to generate the HTML.

The Antora generator retrieves Asciidoctor sources from our documentation content repositories, and then generate a static HTML website from those sources.

[NOTE]
====
A GitHub workflow is available to generate this static documentation (useful for oldest version not host on this documentation site).
====

== UI Bundle

The UI bundle source repository can be found here: https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-theme[bonita-documentation-theme].

The UI Bundle architecture is detailed on the UI bundle Readme.

== Search solution: Algolia

Because of our open source status, https://docsearch.algolia.com/[DocSearch by Algolia] offers us freely a search solution (Thanks a lot to them! ❤️). +
The configuration file can be found https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/bonitasoft.json[here].
This file indicates to the DocSearch crawler the pages to crawl, and the elements to index.


== Host solution: Netlify

The documentation is hosted on https://app.netlify.com/sites/documentation-bonita[Netlify].

Netlify allow us to manage redirection with the `netlify.toml` file at root of this repository.
