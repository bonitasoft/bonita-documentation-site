= Netlify redirects configuration

== Configuration files

We use a `netlify.toml` file at the root of the project.

See the https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-netlify-configuration-file[Netlify documentation]
for more details about the how to configure the redirects.

== Testing the redirects

Currently, we manually test the redirects by deploying the `netlify.toml` file on a single page test site using the Netlify
dashboard. In this case, we only want to check the redirects, so we don't care to have real pages available. +
We don't update the redirects very often, so this is enough for our current usage.

See https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonitasoft.github.io/issues/168[#168] for a more integrated solution.
