==== Cards

You can use card style in your page.

image::images/displayCard.png[Html Card Display,200,100]

You can update *link*, *title* and description for each card.

To do it, you need to use this following syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
[.card-section]
== Highlight

[.card.card-index]
--
yourInternalOrExternalLink[[.card-title]#Card Title# [.card-body.card-content-overflow]#pass:q[You can write a little description here to display it in the card body.]#]
--

----

You can use many card in same card section. +
Please keep this technical syntax to avoid error.

NOTE: If you wanna see a real example, please consult the index.adoc file in https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-doc/blob/7.12/md/index.md[bonita documentation github repository].

WARNING: If description in card body is too long (more than 3 lines), we will hide the excess.

==== GitHub may not rendered admonition

==== Antora modules

// Antora modules to clarify content (for instance, getting-started guides, how-to articles): https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/module-directories/#module.

==== Alias when renaming pages

IMPORTANT: Impact on SEO

==== Adding link between two components

//reference to documentation pages of another component: for instance, bcd doc has link to bonita doc. To avoid hard coded url, use https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/ (see https://opendevise.com/blog/referencing-pages/ for rationale). Warn: won't work with PR preview in the document content repository, as that kind of preview only build a single component version

== How to integrate a new component

// examples directory to store source code which can then easily be integrated in the doc https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/examples-directory/ We should allow user to download the source as attachments by providing a link directly for the code (no dup between actual examples and doc)
