We are pleased to receive any kind of contribution (issues, pull requests, suggestions ...).

== Contribution check

Before opening a pull request, please check our few recommendations:

Verify that each updated `adoc` file starts with:

[source,adoc]
----
= A short title
:description: Put just after title (without whitespace) a short description to explain what we can retrieve in this page.

You can put you content after metadata block
----

NOTE: This metadata information is useful to improve our visibility for search engine (SEO)


== Short presentation of the documentation environment

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoc] is the markup language chosen to write our documentation content.
You can check the official documentation site to learn more on Asciidoc syntax.

If you know the Markdown syntax, please check the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/asciidoc-vs-markdown[Asciidoc vs Markdown]
documentation comparison to speedup the learning.

We are using https://docs.antora.org/[Antora] to generate the Bonita documentation.

For more details about how the generation works, see the xref:../architecture.adoc[Architecture documentation] and the
xref:../README.adoc[development documentation].


== Tips for writing the documentation content

=== Embed videos

It is possible to embed videos as it is done in Bonita 2021.1 index page: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/audio-and-video/

* A default/max size is set for the mobile view
* there is no default for the desktop view at the moment, so you should set the dimensions when declaring the `video` macro
as in the following example
[example]
+video::038g85tvzo4[youtube, width=640,height=380]+

=== Asciinema

https://asciinema.org/[Asciinema] provides a great way for sharing shell sessions recording, making documentation more lively !

Once you have created a `.cast` file, you can add it to your document with the following markup

.sample asciinema adoc.
[source, asciidoc]
----
== Asciinema embedded

Example of embedded asciinema recording:

++++
<asciinema-player src="_images/images/<path_to_your_cast_file>.cast" speed="2" theme="monokai" title="Example of embedded asciinema recording" cols="240" rows="32"></asciinema-player>
++++
----

The generated asciidoctor (before transformation by Antora) document should render like something like this:
[.thumb]
image::images/asciinema_sample_rendering.png[]

=== Cards

You can use card style in your page. Please don't abuse it, and try to only use it on index pages.

.Card display in after HTML generation
You can update *link*, *title* and description for each card.

To do it, you need to use this following syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
[.card-section]
== Highlight

[.card.card-index]
--
yourInternalOrExternalLink[[.card-title]#Card Title# [.card-body.card-content-overflow]#pass:q[You can write a short description here to display it in the card body.]#]
--

----

You can use many cards in same card section. +
Please keep this technical syntax to avoid error.

NOTE: If you want to see a real example, please consult the index.adoc file in https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-doc/blob/7.12/md/index.md[bonita documentation GitHub repository].

WARNING: If description in card body is too long (more than 3 lines), we will hide the excess.


=== Custom admonition for Cloud

see https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-theme/pull/53


=== Variables and attributes

You can define asciidoc attributes in the `antora.yml` file at repository root and reference it in content page.
For a detailed documentation about attributes, see the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/attribute-entry-substitutions/[asciidoc attribute documentation].

[source,yml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    bonitaVersion: 2021.1
----

[example]
Use `{bonitaVersion}` syntax to reference this attribute in content. It will be replaced by `2021.1` for each occurrence.


=== Disabling attribute substitution

Any elements around braces are interpreted as attribute and so, Asciidoctor tries to substitute them. If the value around braces is not related to
a declared attributes, warnings are emitted when generating the html files. +
For instance, in `+${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/jaas.cfg+`, Asciidoctor tries by default to substitute `CATALINA_HOME` which is not something we want
as we want to document an example with bash substitution.

To disable attribute substitution in inline text, add a `+` character around the text that contains the braces

* globally around an inline code extract like `\+${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/jaas.cfg+`
* just around the braces: `$+{CATALINA_HOME}+/conf/jaas.cfg`

See https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/pass/pass-macro/#inline-passthrough-macros for more details.


=== Attributes substitution in blocks

Notice that by default there is no attribute substitution in blocks, so extra configuration is needed in that case.
More details are available in https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/subs/apply-subs-to-blocks/

We recommend to use explicit macro on part of the block that requires substitution. This allows to mix the `{..}` for elements that
should not been substituted (for instance, maven properties or bash variables).

In the block, enable the macros by adding the `subs` configuration like `[source,xml,subs="+macros"]` and in the block content, set `pass:a[{...}]` around
the attribute you want to substitute. For instance, `<bonita.version>pass:a[{bonitaVersion}].0</bonita.version>`. +
This configuration then let parts like `<version>${bonita.version}</version>` not substituted.

It is also possible to configure substitution globally for the block (see the documentation).


=== GitHub may not render admonitions

See this https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/admonitions/#using-emoji-for-admonition-icons[asciidoc documentation] for more details.

=== Antora modules

You can use Antora modules to clarify content (for instance, getting-started guides, how-to articles). +
See https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/module-directories/#module.

[quote]
____
Modules allow to better separate content and resources (for instance specific images and
attachments). For Bonita doc, this will avoid for instance to have all "getting started" pages at
the same level as other pages (currently in the md folder): easier to identify what pages and images
are related to "getting started", easier maintenance, ....
____


=== Alias when renaming pages

IMPORTANT: Impact on SEO

See https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-aliases. +
Successfully experimented in https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-ici-doc#123

=== Adding link between two components or between versions of the same component

For instance

* the BCD documentation contains links to various versions of the Bonita documentation (see https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-continuous-delivery-doc/pull/164[PR #164]).
* the Bonita release-notes 7.9 contain a link to the latest BCD version (see https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-doc/pull/1494[PR #1494])

To avoid introducing hard coded url, follow the Antora documentation (see https://opendevise.com/blog/referencing-pages/ for rationale)

* https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/
* https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/version-and-component-xrefs/

[WARNING]
====
The generated site available in PR preview in the document content repository is not able to resolve such references, as
that kind of preview only build a single component version.
To be able to see them during documentation content writing, you need to build the documentation with both the source and
target component versions. See https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site/pull/222[PR #222] for more details.
====


=== Make examples available as downloadable file

The `examples` directory can be used to store source code which can then easily be integrated in the documentation. +
See https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/examples-directory/

This allows user to download the source as attachments by providing a link directly for the code (no duplication between the actual examples and the documentation)
