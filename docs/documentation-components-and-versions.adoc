CAUTION: this is a work in progress

NOTE: the following mainly applies to the Bonita Platform documentation part

== Bonita versions that are documented

For Bonita, the rule is the following one: +
We document the 4 currently supported Bonita versions, and **the 4 versions before**. +

=== Impact on Algolia DocSearch

Each time a new version of a documented Bonitasoft project is released, this DocSearch configuration file has to be updated:

- The latest version has to be added to the projects to index
- The oldest version should be removed from the projects to index

-> It means that the DocSearch conf file should reflect this behavior.


== Versions lifecycle

NOTE: *this is a work in progress*. TODO link lifecycle actions to the how-to later described in this page

NOTE: this mainly applies to Bonita Platform but all components with multi-supported versions should follow the same rules

GA release (actions to be performed detailed later in this document):

* remove the prerelease configuration (see below)
* update the redirect to make the latest token url go to the new GA version
* archive the oldest version
* mark the 5th version as out of support: On new Bonita Platform GA release, an old version is considered as out of support.

== DocSearch and component versions

=== Don't use Antora component without version

No version Antora component: https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/component-with-no-version/

The documentation site search crawling and widget we have setup, require a component and a version. In case of version less
components, there is no version token in the url, so this defeats the mechanism in place.

See https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-labs-doc/pull/127#discussion_r585309113 for extra information.


=== DocSearch configuration

The DocSearch configuration is public and can be updated by submitting Pull Request: https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/bonitasoft.json

See https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+bonitasoft[past Pull Requests] for inspiration.


== General how-to for components and versions management

=== How to integrate a new component

Add a new source in the Antora playbook and reference a new branch. In this branch, put a `antora.yml` file at root which contains:

To add a new component, you first need to create a GitHub repository which will contain the asciidoc sources of this component
(i.e. the documentation content). This repository must be organized according to the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/organize-content-files/[Antora recommendations].
You can check existing repositories for working examples.
At minimum, it will contain an `antora.yml` file at its root

[source,yml]
----
name: componentName
title: yourTitle
version: yourVersion
asciidoc:
 attributes:
  # define here attributes you need to templatize the documentation content or the html generation
nav:
- modules/ROOT/taxonomy.adoc
----

Then, you need to add a new source in the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonitasoft.github.io/blob/master/antora-playbook.yml[Antora playbook].
A source references the URL of the repository and all the branches to retrieve.

Finally, you have to update the https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/bonitasoft.json[search configuration]
to make this component searchable.


=== How to integrate a new version of an existing component

When we need to add a new version of one component, we need to:

. Create a new branch (in the repository related to the component)
. To add a new component, you first need to create a GitHub repository which will contain the asciidoc sources of this component (i.e. the documentation content).
This repository must be organized according to the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/organize-content-files/[Antora recommendations].
You can check existing repositories for working examples.
. Then, you need to add a new source in the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonitasoft.github.io/blob/master/antora-playbook.yml[Antora playbook].
A source references the URL of the repository and all the branches to retrieve.
. Finally, you have to update the https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/bonitasoft.json[search configuration]
to make this component searchable.

=== How to remove a component version and make an archive available

On new Bonita Platform GA release, an old version must be archived.

. Take the oldest one
. Run the archive GitHub Actions: this creates a new tag on the related component version
. Create a PR targeting the bonita-doc archives branch and add the new archive version to the list
. Remove the version from the Antora Playbook
. Remove the version from the Algolia DocSearch configuration
. Add a redirect to manage urls of the old version. See https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site/pull/182[PR #182],
https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site/pull/195[PR #195] or https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site/pull/201[PR #201]
. in the documentation content repository, remove the GH workflow that triggers the push to production
. .... *TODO* more info here, and link with lifecycle


=== Mark version as 'Out of Support'

Edit the related antora.yml file of the component version, and make the pages non-editable

[source,yml]
----
name: componentName
...
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    # remove the 'Edit this Page' link in all pages
    page-editable: false
    # display a dedicated banner to warn the reader about the out-of-support state
    page-out-of-support: true
----

=== Mark version as 'Next-release'

Edit the related antora.yml file of the component version, make the content not searchable, and adding an information message.

[source,yml]
----
name: componentName
# TODO: When we are in beta release, put version: theRealVersion
version: 1
# TODO: remove this line when we are in beta phase
display_version: 2022.1-alpha
# TODO when integrating this version to the documentation, update push-content.yml and replace alpha by beta
prerelease: alpha
...
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    # Adding an info message on the top of any pages
    page-next-release: true
    # remove search bar for this version (Because the content of next-release is not indexing by Algolia)
    page-hide-search-bar: true
----


=== Pre-release versions

apply to beta and RC versions

See https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/component-prerelease/ to know how to

* mark a prerelease version
* display beta/rc additionnal information in the version
* impact on default version and version ordering
