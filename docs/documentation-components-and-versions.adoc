CAUTION: this is a work in progress

NOTE: the following mainly applies to the Bonita Platform documentation part

== Bonita versions that are documented

For Bonita, the rule is the following one: +
We document the 4 currently supported Bonita versions, and **the 4 versions before**. +

== Impact on Algolia DocSearch

Each time a new version of a documented Bonitasoft project is released, this DocSearch configuration file has to be updated:

- The latest version has to be added to the projects to index
- The oldest version should be removed from the projects to index

-> It means that the DocSearch conf file should reflect this behavior.


== General how-to for components and versions management
