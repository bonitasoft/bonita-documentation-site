This repository lets you generate the Bonita documentation site. It uses {url-antora}[Antora] which processes {url-asciidoc}:[AsciiDoc]
documentation content stored in various Git repositories.


== Documentation

See the xref:docs/README.adoc[dedicated folder] for

* documentation content contribution tips/guidelines
* architecture
* maintainers guides
* and much more

More details are available in the xref:docs/architecture.adoc[Architecture Documentation].


== Build

=== Requirements


{url-node}[Node 16.x] (may work with newer versions, no guarantee).

While you can install Node from the official packages, we strongly recommend that you use {url-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager) to install and manage Node.
Follow the {url-nvm-install}[nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine. Then run `nvm use`.

[NOTE]
====
* all commands are intended to be run from the repository root folder.
* the generated documentation is available in the `build/site` folder.
====

Don't forget to run `npm install` the first time you build the project or on `package.json` changes.

Check that the `Antora` CLI is available by calling `./node_modules/.bin/antora --version`.


[#non-production-build]
== Non production build

[[preview]]
=== Preview support

The easiest way is to use a script that generates the documentation partially and/or with specific settings for both local
developments, Pull Request previews or to produce documentation archives.

This includes building the documentation using:

* already checkout local documentation content repositories
* single branch for all components
* single branch of a single component
* a set of branches of various components. It lets validate {url-antora-docs}/page/page-links/[references between pages that belong to different docs components and/or versions]
* ....

To know all available options, run
[source,shell script]
----
./build-preview.bash --help
----

[NOTE]
=====
An additional `build-preview-dev.bash` script is available: it calls `build-preview.bash` with convenient defaults for
local build. +
In the following, we use both scripts indifferently.
=====

[source,shell script]
.Build a single component version using locally modified document content sources (see <<local-content, required setup>>)
----
./build-preview-dev.bash --local-sources \
  --component bonita \
  --branch fix/a_major_documentation_content_fix
----

[source,shell script]
.Build BCD 3.4, Bonita 7.11 and Bonita 2021.1 versions (cross reference component versions check)
----
./build-preview-dev.bash \
  --use-multi-repositories \
  --component-with-branches bcd:3.4 \
  --component-with-branches bonita:7.11,2021.1
----

==== Preview support overview

The documentation is built by passing a playbook file to the Antora CLI. For more details, see
{url-antora-docs}/cli/options/[Antora CLI documentation].

For the preview support, we generate a dedicated Antora playbook based on the production playbook store in the repository
and options passed to the `build-preview.bash`. +
Then, this custom playbook is passed to the Antora CLI along with specific options when needed.


[[local-content]]
===== Using local documentation content repositories

This activates the {url-antora-docs}/playbook/author-mode/[Antora author mode]. +
Antora uses the locally cloned repositories as they are on your local machine instead of cloning them from their remote location.

This provides a fast feedback loop as you don't need to push nor commit sources content. This also makes developments easier when working offline.

[NOTE]
.Repositories location
====
This requires to clone content sources repositories locally is the parent folder of this project.
Depending on which sources you use (see the options of the bash script), you may have to clone all, or a part of the repositories
used by the Bonita documentation.

For instance:
----
root
  |
  -- bonita-cloud-doc
  |
  -- bonita-continuous-delivery-doc
  |
  -- bonita-doc
  |
  -- bonita-documentation-site
  |
  -- bonita-labs-doc
----
====

This can be achieved by running

[source,shell script]
----
./build-preview-dev.bash --local-sources ....
----

===== Using test documentation content

To play with settings, validate the UI Bundle, experiment AsciiDoc syntax and much more, the `bonita-documentation-site` repository provides
a test site structure with documentation content.

The generation site generation is very fast, so using this content reduces the feedback loop.

This can be achieved by running

[source,shell script]
----
./build-preview-dev.bash --use-test-sources ....
----

[[local-ui-bundle]]
===== Using local UI Bundle

The prebuilt UI Bundle is stored in this repository and sources are located in the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-theme[bonita-documentation theme]
repository. +
If you are developing in the theme repository and want to see the resulting changes in the documentation, you can directly
use the UI Bundle built by the theme repository. +
This provides a fast feedback loop as you don't need to build copy the UI bundle from the theme repository and then run
a build command: everything can be done by running a single command once the push nor commit content as the current work.

Remember that the theme repository provides a preview with mock content that make development easier. But sometimes, integration
tests are required to ensure everything is ok, especially when dealing with {url-antora-docs}/playbook/site-keys/[site keys].

[NOTE]
.Repositories location
====
This requires to clone the theme repository locally is the parent folder of this project.
For instance
----
root
  |
  -- bonita-documentation-theme
  |
  -- bonita-documentation-site
----
====

This can be achieved by running

[source,shell script]
----
./build-preview-dev.bash --local-ui-bundle ...
----

For a faster loop, don't forget you can build the UI Bundle and the preview by chaining the commands

[source,shell script]
----
<ui_bundle_build_command> ; ./build-preview-dev.bash --local-ui-bundle ...
----

===== Using the Default Antora UI

Sometimes, you need to compare the site rendering with this bundle if you suspect a bug in the Bonita documentation theme.

This can be achieved by running

[source,shell script]
----
./build-preview-dev.bash --default-ui-bundle ...
----

If you want to ensure you use the latest version of the bundle pass `--default-ui-bundle snapshot`. Otherwise, a cache
version is used. For more details, see the {url-antora-docs}/playbook/ui-bundle-url/#snapshot[Antora Documentation]


===== Quick fix and experiment Antora UI changes directly in the documentation site

If you need/want to experiment changes without rebuilding the theme, especially if the changes only involve the template,
you can directly put the files in the documentation site.

See the {url-antora-docs}/playbook/ui-supplemental-files/[Antora supplemental UI] for a complete explanation.


==== http dev server

[NOTE]
====
Most of the time, pages can be browsed locally without requiring a http dev server. +
You may need it to test specific features like displaying Asciinema resources or testing redirects. See below for more details.
====


Once the static site is build, you can run `npm run serve` and access it with `+http://localhost:8080+` to check if everything is working correctly (urls in taxonomy, links, ....).

You can rebuild the site while the server is running, updated files are directly considered by the server (no cache).

To ensure all links are correctly generated for local deployment, pass the `+--site-url http://localhost:8080+` options
when building the preview.

[TIP]
====
A http server is needed to correctly see the Asciinema resources (loading fail when using a local file browsing). +
For instance, have a look at http://localhost:8080/bonita/2021.1/migrate-from-an-earlier-version-of-bonita-bpm#update-case-overview-pages
====

[TIP]
====
The http dev server is provided by the https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/[Netlify CLI], so it is able to replicate a lot of the Netlify Edge features. +
In particular it is able to apply the same redirects as those used in production.

See for xref:docs/configure-netlify-redirects.adoc[configure Netlify redirects how-to] more details.
====



=== Production build

WARNING: This is probably something you won't often do as the site is not fully working for local browsing nor for simple http server.

[CAUTION]
====
The following command {url-antora-docs}/playbook/runtime-fetch/[fetch the documentation content repositories] each time it runs. +
See <<non-production-build>> for alternatives.
====

Run `npm run build`
