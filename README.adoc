= New Bonita Documentation Site

DISCLAIMER: this is a work in progress.


== Architecture

*_This is a starting draft_*

Static site generation based on https://antora.org/:[Antora] from documentation https://asciidoctor.org/:[Asciidoctor] content.


== Build

*Requirements*: Node 12.x (may work with newer versions, no guarantee). For more details, see the  https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install-and-run-quickstart/[Antora installation guide].

Run
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
The static site is then available in the `build` folder.


The `antora` CLI is available by calling `./node_modules/.bin/antora --version`
